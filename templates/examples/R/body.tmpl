XXX
- one more time briefly about the purpose of the tutorial

{{template "scrollToContinue"}}

<p>
XXX
- briefly what hardware and software components are required
- introduce what step-by-step will happen during this tutorial
    - ping / rping connectivity check
    - a simple "just esablish a connection" program
    - the final program general idea

{{step "Connectivity check"}}

<p>
XXX
- describe the networking environment (IPs etc.)

{{edit "run_test_ping.sh"}}

{{run "./run_test_ping.sh"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce rping(1)

XXX It seems the rping script (and other two-sided scripts)
may work in the following way:

{{edit "run_test_rping.sh"}}

{{run "./run_test_rping.sh"}}

{{step "Establishing a connection"}}

<p>
XXX
- briefly introduce the librpma library
- the following program focuses solely on establishing a connection

{{edit "simple_client.c" "simple_server.c" "connection.h" "connection.c" "CMakeLists.txt" "build_simple.sh"}}

{{build "./build_simple.sh"}}

{{edit "run_simple.sh"}}

{{run "./run_simple.sh"}}

{{step "Remote Persistent Memory access"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce used rpma_read/write/flush() operations and
- describe their role in achieving the assumed aim
- refer the "connection.h" "connection.c" files are taken from the previous step

{{edit "client.c" "server.c" "connection.h" "build_xxx.sh"}}

{{build "./build_xxx.sh"}}

{{edit "run_xxx.sh"}}

{{run "./run_xxx.sh"}}
